Are there any international students in the coops?
Yes, this game was made by one ;) Also, international students have a shorter waiting list, so apply today if you are interested!
How are chores divided?
All house members get to do a fair share of the work, and typically have one hard chore (e.g. cooking together with another house member once or deep-cleaning bathrooms) and one easy chore (e.g. bringing out compost, light cleaning of bathrooms etc.) per week. In addition, we take turns to tidy up the kitchen and wash leftover dishes in pairs in the evenings. (This is not applicable for the Newman house, which doesn't have a meal plan). 
What are house officers?
Every member has an officer post every quarter, for example garden manager (tends to garden), social manager (organizes parties and such), education manager (organizes educational events such as documentary screenings), meeting secretary, house president, food shopper and maintenance manager. The more demanding of the manager posts are reimbursed. If the manager posts are filled you can do a project that benefits the coops in general (this game is an example of that).
I'm a big fan of democracy, do you have meetings?
Yes! We have house meetings, where everybody discusses and votes on topics related to the house (Anybody can suggest topics of discussion). You can also be on the coop commitee as a manager post (these meetings are also open for anybody). 
What's the rent?
Rent depends on what house you live in and if you live in a double or single room. For up-to-date info about rent, please visit sbcoop.org. 
I want to eat in the coops but not sleep there. Is that possible?
Yes indeed! You can become a food boarder, meaning that you only pay for food.
